# Galaxy Classicube
All Credit goes to UnknownShadow200

At the moment, Galaxy Classicube has been updated to the latest version of ClassiCube, however, I have not had time to fix the GUI back to what it has been, I promise that it will return back to how it was over time, which shouldn't take too long.

I will show screenshots soon. (If I can get windows builds working)
